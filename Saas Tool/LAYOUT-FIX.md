# ✅ **Layout Fixed - Contacts Tab Overflow Issue Resolved!**

## 🐛 **Problem:**
- Collapsible sections were taking up too much space
- Content didn't fit in the popup window
- Layout was broken and cluttered

## ✅ **Solution:**

### **Moved sections to BOTTOM of Contacts tab**
Instead of having collapsible sections between stats and table, they're now at the bottom after the action buttons.

### **New Layout Order:**
1. Stats Row (Total, Pending, New)
2. Search & Filters
3. Bulk Actions Toolbar
4. **Main Contacts Table** ← The focus!
5. Pagination
6. Action Buttons (Export, Refresh)
7. **Collapsible Sections** ← Moved here!
   - Today's Contacts
   - Pending Approvals
   - Recent Contacts
   - Rejected Contacts

### **Made sections more compact:**
- Smaller headers (13px font)
- Compact padding (8px)
- Max height with scroll (200px)
- Smaller buttons
- Only show when they have content

## 📊 **Benefits:**

✅ **Main table gets priority** - Most important content first  
✅ **No overflow** - Everything fits in popup  
✅ **Still accessible** - Sections at bottom for quick access  
✅ **Cleaner** - Less clutter at the top
